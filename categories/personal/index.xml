I gave a presentation. I went to a market called The Festival by SALESAS. I tried the matcha latte from Bianchi Kiosko Caff√©. I made a King Cake for the first time. I had a presentation on Thursday. I was a little nervous going into it because it was a very long presentation. We had the whole class, two whole hours, to present on social responsibility as it relates to universities.</description></item><item><title>Anasazi Style Rim-blown Flute</title><link>https://patrick-herke.com/posts/projects/anasazi-flute-elderberry/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://patrick-herke.com/posts/projects/anasazi-flute-elderberry/</guid><description>Playing a custom composition on an Anasazi Style rim-blown flute while outdoors.
My goal with this project was to design, build, and learn to play a rim-blown flute based on the Anasazi flutes found in the American Southwest. The original idea sprung from a chance encounter with whistles made from elderberry wood which led down a rabbit hole into full blown flute making.
Finished flute against grass. Four Anasazi Flutes from the Broken Flute Cave.</description></item></channel></rss>
