I gave a presentation. I went to a market called The Festival by SALESAS. I tried the matcha latte from Bianchi Kiosko Caff√©. I made a King Cake for the first time. I had a presentation on Thursday. I was a little nervous going into it because it was a very long presentation. We had the whole class, two whole hours, to present on social responsibility as it relates to universities.</description></item></channel></rss>
