# a summary about you
summary: "I am a senior mechanical engineering student who is currently taking a semester off to gain experience by working a co-op. As an undergrad, I've done research on creating a better cervical collar using granular jamming and 3D printing. I also enjoy working on various personal projects ranging from creating replicas of ancient Anasazi rim-blown flutes to building a yogurt maker."
