Filter press plates should not need to be regularly replaced, but they were replacing the entire set every 3-5 months for ~$12,000 each time.
Shows leaking of the filter press and associated bowing of the plates. Consistency of cake material is also shown. All pictures were taken ~1 week before plate swap.
Examining the filter press manual thoroughly, I discovered that toluene, one of the process chemicals, was listed as chemically incompatible with the polypropylene plates.</description></item></channel></rss>
