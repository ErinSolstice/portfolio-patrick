      <title>Week 5</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I gave a presentation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I went to a market called &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.esmadrid.com/en/whats-on/salesas-village&#34;&gt;The Festival by SALESAS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I tried the matcha latte from Bianchi Kiosko Caffé.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I made a King Cake for the first time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a presentation on Thursday. I was a little nervous going into it because it was a very long presentation. We had the whole class, two whole hours, to present on social responsibility as it relates to universities. Aside from a very basic script that we spent maybe 15 or 30 minutes on and then never re-visited, everyone kept their own separate notes. So, it was very difficult to organize the presentation as you couldn&amp;rsquo;t really see the big picture. In the end it went well, but it was more like a collection of different presentations than a single presentation. It didn&amp;rsquo;t flow well.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Cervical Collars</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/projects/cervical-collar/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Cervical collars are neck braces used for suspected spinal trauma and for post-surgical stabilization of the spine. Current cervical collars allow too much freedom of movement and have limited options for an individualized fit. I am using granular jamming and 3-D printing to resolve those problems. Granular jamming occurs when granular media, like coffee grounds, are placed under vacuum and become hard and rigid; by contrast, when not under vacuum, the bladder can be molded to the patient’s neck.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Filter Press Troubleshooting</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/projects/filter-press/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The plates of the filter press were undergoing significant warping resulting in poor filtering, bypass, and leakage.  Filter press plates should not need to be regularly replaced, but they were replacing the entire set every 3-5 months for ~$12,000 each time.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Designing an Iontophoresis Device</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/projects/iontophoresis-device/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the accepted treatments for hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating) is iontophoresis. Iontophoresis involves running a small current through the hands, feet, or armpits of the patient. Some people set the current whereas others set the voltage for a session. I wanted to see if these control methods were equivalent. Safety concerns around the body and electricity are obviously very important and complicated. RA Fischer, a manufacturer of an FDA approved device, has max settings of 30mA and 58V. To be on the safe side, I chose to use only 9V in my tests.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Blender Teardown SolidWorks Drawings</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As part of a class project for Sophomore Design, my team did a teardown of a blender. For our report, we created Solidworks models of the most interesting components. Presented here are two of the drawings that I did for the brush assembly of the DC motor of the blender.&lt;/p&gt;
