      <description>The plates of the filter press were undergoing significant warping resulting in poor filtering, bypass, and leakage. Filter press plates should not need to be regularly replaced, but they were replacing the entire set every 3-5 months for ~$12,000 each time.
Leaking of filter press. All pictures were taken ~1 week before plate swap. Roughly middle of stack. Shows plates bowing inward towards the center. Most visible by looking at top edge of plate.</description>
