      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I gave a presentation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I went to a market called &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.esmadrid.com/en/whats-on/salesas-village&#34;&gt;The Festival by SALESAS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I tried the matcha latte from Bianchi Kiosko Caff√©.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I made a King Cake for the first time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a presentation on Thursday. I was a little nervous going into it because it was a very long presentation. We had the whole class, two whole hours, to present on social responsibility as it relates to universities. Aside from a very basic script that we spent maybe 15 or 30 minutes on and then never re-visited, everyone kept their own separate notes. So, it was very difficult to organize the presentation as you couldn&amp;rsquo;t really see the big picture. In the end it went well, but it was more like a collection of different presentations than a single presentation. It didn&amp;rsquo;t flow well.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
